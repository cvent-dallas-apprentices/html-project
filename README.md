- **Store Page**: Showcases our range of ice cream products, allowing customers to browse and select items they wish to purchase.
- **CheckOut Page**: Allow the user to pay for the items in their shopping cart.
  
All pages feature a sticky top navigation bar to ensure easy navigation across the website.
